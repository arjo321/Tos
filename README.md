# Privacy Policy for CRIS07

_Last updated: [17th/aug/2025]_

Thank you for using **CRIS07**, a Discord bot designed to enhance your server experience. Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy explains what data CRIS07 collects, how it is used, and your rights regarding that data.

---

## 1. Information We Collect
CRIS07 may collect and temporarily store the following types of information:

- **User Data**: Discord user IDs, usernames, and message content (only if required for specific features like moderation, snipe, AFK, or logging).  
- **Server Data**: Server IDs, channel IDs, and role IDs for configuration (e.g., welcome/leave messages, reaction roles, or prefix settings).  
- **Interaction Data**: Commands used, timestamps, and responses generated by the bot.  

CRIS07 does **not** collect sensitive information such as emails, passwords, or payment details.

## 2. How We Use Your Data
The collected data is only used to:

- Provide core bot functionality (commands, moderation, games, logging, etc.).  
- Customize server configurations (prefixes, welcome messages, reaction roles).  
- Improve bot performance and fix issues.  

We do **not** sell, trade, or share your data with third parties.

## 3. Data Storage & Retention
- Data is stored **locally** (or in a database if configured).  
- Temporary data (like message snipes) is deleted automatically after a short period.  
- Permanent configurations (like prefixes or welcome channels) remain until you remove the bot or reset them.  

If CRIS07 is removed from your server, stored server-related data will also be deleted.

## 4. Sharing of Data
CRIS07 does not share your data with anyone except:  

- **Discord** (as required to function, following Discordâ€™s [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy)).

## 5. Your Rights
You have the right to:

- Request the deletion of your data by contacting the bot owner.  
- Remove CRIS07 from your server at any time, which deletes stored configurations.

## 6. Security
We take reasonable steps to secure your data. However, no system is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute protection.
